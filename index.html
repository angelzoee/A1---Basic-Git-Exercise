                    <p class="about__text">I’m Angel Zoe Mangay-ayam, born on June 7, 2005, at Lorma Medical Center. I
                        live in Candon City, Ilocos Sur, and I am the oldest of three siblings. My younger sister,
                        Destiny Mangay-ayam, is studying Veterinary Medicine at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State
                        University, while my youngest sibling, Gladden Mar Mangay-ayam, is still in high school at St.
                        Joseph Institute Inc. Like most siblings, we fought over the silliest things—toys, food, or even
                        who got to sit in the best spot. These little disagreements often ended in tears or pouts, but
                        they never lasted long. No matter how much we argued, we always made up. Over time, I realized
                        these moments were not about winning or losing; they were about building a bond that would last
                        a lifetime.

            <div class="container">
                <div>
                    <p class="about__text"> My parents, Marlon and Soledad Mangay-ayam, run a small but thriving
                        business. They specialize in printer repairs and bookbinding, crafting both hardbound and
                        softbound books. Growing up, I admired their hard work and dedication, which inspired me to
                        pursue my dreams with the same level of determination.

                        When I was seven years old, my siblings, cousins, and I often played at our neighbor’s house
                        until the clock struck 5 PM. Those afternoons were filled with laughter and games, but we would
                        sometimes lose track of time. By the time we got home, our grandma was usually waiting for us,
                        visibly upset. It was a lesson we learned the hard way, but those carefree moments remain some
                        of my fondest memories.


                        Every year, my family makes it a point to come together with our extended relatives. Whether
                        it’s during Christmas, birthdays, or any random weekend, we find a reason to gather. These
                        occasions are filled with good food, laughter, and happy memories. My grandparents, aunts, and
                        uncles have played significant roles in my life, providing support and advice whenever I needed
                        it. From teaching me family traditions to sharing valuable life lessons, they’ve shown me the
                        importance of sticking together no matter what.

                        Some of my favorite moments involve sitting around with my family, exchanging stories, laughing
                        over funny memories, and playing games with my cousins. These bonding moments remind me how
                        lucky I am to have such a close-knit and loving family.

                        During my nursery and kindergarten years, my grandparents were my babysitters. They were always
                        there for me, even acting as my protectors. I remember one particular instance when a classmate
                        tried to take my pencil or chocolate, and my lola immediately came to my defense. My nursery
                        days were filled with innocence and fun, and I made many friends and playmates at school. Life
                        felt so simple back then, and we were all just beginning to discover the world around us. After
                        two joyful years, I graduated from Shepherd Kiddie School, marking my first academic milestone.
                        From Grade 1 to Grade 5, I studied at Allangigan Elementary, which was
                        conveniently close to my house. These years were full of amazing experiences. I participated
                        in scouting camps, helped clean school grounds and classrooms, and formed lasting
                        friendships with my classmates. However, not every moment was perfect. When I was in Grade
                        5, one of my classmates bullied me by calling me “piggy.” It hurt deeply, and I cried a lot.
                        My lola wasn’t around to comfort me as she was busy at home. Despite this painful memory, I
                        learned to stand up for myself and became stronger as a result.

                        In Grade 6, I transferred to Saint Joseph Institute, which was closer to my parents’ shop.
                        At first, I felt shy and out of place. I had no friends and often ate lunch alone. One day,
                        two of my classmates noticed me sitting by myself and decided to join me. We started
                        talking, laughing, and sharing stories, and that marked the beginning of a beautiful
                        friendship. Their kindness and warmth made me realize how important it is to reach out and
                        make others feel included.

                        When I entered Grade 7, my mom enrolled me in the Candon Music Orchestra. Every Saturday and
                        Sunday, I attended beginner violin classes. Learning to play the violin was both challenging
                        and rewarding. I practiced diligently and found immense joy in creating music. Over the
                        years, playing the violin became a significant part of my life. It not only enhanced my
                        creativity but also taught me the value of discipline and perseverance. I continued playing
                        until I graduated from senior high school.

                    <div>
                        <p class="about__text"> My high school years were filled with both challenges and triumphs.
                            Transitioning from elementary to high school was a significant change, but it allowed me to
                            grow academically, socially, and personally. At Saint Joseph Institute, I met wonderful
                            teachers and friends who encouraged me to strive for excellence. I discovered my passion for
                            technology, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Studies at Lorma
                            Colleges.

                            Throughout my academic journey, my family remained my constant source of support and
                            motivation. My parents’ hard work and determination inspired me to dream big, while my
                            siblings and grandparents provided love and encouragement.

                            Beyond academics, my family’s annual gatherings continued to strengthen our bond. Whether it
                            was a festive Christmas celebration, a memorable birthday party, or a spontaneous weekend
                            get-together, these moments brought us closer together. Sharing meals, playing games, and
                            reminiscing about old times reminded me of the importance of family and the joy of creating
                            lasting memories.

                            Reflecting on my life so far, I realize how fortunate I am to have such a loving and
                            supportive family. My parents’ small business taught me the value of hard work and
                            resourcefulness, while my grandparents’ wisdom guided me through challenges. My siblings,
                            despite our occasional disagreements, have been my lifelong companions and friends. The
                            lessons I’ve learned from my family and the experiences we’ve shared have shaped me into the
                            person I am today.

                            As I look to the future, I carry with me the values and memories that my family has
                            instilled in me. I am grateful for the love, laughter, and lessons that have filled my life,
                            and I am excited to create new memories while cherishing the old ones. No matter where life
                            takes me, I know that my family will always be my foundation, my inspiration, and my
                            greatest source of joy.
